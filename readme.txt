------PREREQUISITES-------

1. Download and install an application called UIPath and its extension on Chrome
2. Ensure https://recruiter.monster.com.sg/v2/employer_pg.html is opened on the browser before running the program
3. Close any excel sheet named "Profile.csv" before running the program. If you forget, there will be another prompt later on which will remind the user to close the excel file
4. Microsoft Excel 2016 has to be used, if not it would not work (for some reason)

===============================================================
------HOW TO USE------

1. Double click the file "Main.xaml"
2. Click the play button on the top menu which says "Debug File"
3. Enter all the details needed by the program
4. Follow the instructions carefully for each message box
5. Entering data on message box can be shorten with “ENTER” key on the keyboard to click “Ok”

===============================================================
------NOTES------
1. When prompted to close the excel file called "profile.csv", ensure you close the excel sheet whose name is "Profile.csv" if not the program will crash
2. Ensure the screen is at the desktop before clicking "Ok", if you did ever click "ok" before showing your desktop, do not worry. just open the excel sheet manually on your desktop
   and let the program run naturally
3. The program would not work if it is not running Excel 2016, this seems to be a weird bug that would not work. Since I have worked on this project using Excel 16, it will only work
   with Excel '16 only
